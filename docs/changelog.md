hero: Changes to Gu√†rdia 3

# Changelog

## v3.0

- Removed examples folder.
- Removed v2 tests.
- `guardia.v2` becomes simply `guardia`.
- `_type` from `guardia.guards` does not negate the result anymore. This increases clearness.
- Added logical operators in `guardia.init`.
- Added manual.
- Changed the behavior of `_type` as explained in the [Guards Manual](https://git.daelvn.ga/guardia/manual/guards/).
- `_utype` and `_utable` are not exported anymore.
- Removed doc comments from source code.
