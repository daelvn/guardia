# Guàrdia 3 - Function guards for Lua & MoonScript

Guàrdia is a small library in hopes of obsoleting [guard.lua](https://github.com/Yonaba/guard.lua), which is pretty old already if you ask me. This one, to nobody's surprise, is curried and focused on MoonScript, but hey, you're stil free to use it in Lua.

## Installation

```
$ luarocks install guardia
```

You can also use the library manually by just downloading the `guardia` folder, but that's gross.

## License

I'm throwing this, as always, to the public domain, do what you want with it.
